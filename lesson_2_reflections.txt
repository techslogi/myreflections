What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It creates a git repository on the specified folder. You need to do
	this or else you won't be able to use git at all. Init creates the
	necessary folders and files.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is a temporary place where files get added, where 
	they wait for commits to be made, including them.
