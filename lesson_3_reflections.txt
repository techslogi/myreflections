When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Whenever I feel like I have to work on a project from different locantions
  and computers. It also helps giving it a sens of community, where many
  users can edit a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because sometimes you could be making big changes that are not ready yet
  to be published. Also it's not necessary to keep pushing small changes.
  
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  Fork is when you create another repository, just for you, of a source.
  Clone is when you create a copy of a repository.
  Branches are for creating different versions of your software.
  
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  Being able to work on the up-to-date files without worrying about
  conflicts.
