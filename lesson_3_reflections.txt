When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Whenever I feel like I have to work on a project from different locantions
  and computers. It also helps giving it a sens of community, where many
  users can edit a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because sometimes you could be making big changes that are not ready yet
  to be published. Also it's not necessary to keep pushing small changes.
